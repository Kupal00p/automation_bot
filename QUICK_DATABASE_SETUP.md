## Step 2: Import Database Schema

### Option A: Using MySQL Workbench (Recommended - GUI)

1. **Download MySQL Workbench** (if not installed)
   - https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/

2. **Create New Connection**
   - Click "+" next to "MySQL Connections"
   - **Connection Name**: `Railway QuickSell`
   - **Hostname**: `<copy MYSQLHOST from Railway>`
   - **Port**: `<copy MYSQLPORT from Railway>` (usually 3306)
   - **Username**: `<copy MYSQLUSER from Railway>`
   - **Password**: Click "Store in Vault" → `<copy MYSQLPASSWORD>`
   - Click "Test Connection" - should succeed
   - Click "OK"

3. **Import Schema**
   - Double-click your new connection
   - Go to **File** → **Run SQL Script**
   - Navigate to: `C:\Users\erong\OneDrive\Documents\automation_bot\database\quicksell_complete_v2.sql`
   - Click **Start** → Wait for completion
   - Should see "Script executed successfully" ✅

### Option B: Using Command Line

```bash
# Replace with your Railway credentials
mysql -h <MYSQLHOST> -P <MYSQLPORT> -u <MYSQLUSER> -p<MYSQLPASSWORD> <MYSQLDATABASE> < database/quicksell_complete_v2.sql
```

## Step 3: Configure Render Environment Variables

1. **Go to Render Dashboard**: https://dashboard.render.com/

2. **Select Your Service**: `automation-bot-xn9m`

3. **Click "Environment" Tab**

4. **Add These Variables** (click "Add Environment Variable" for each):

   ```
   DB_HOST = <copy MYSQLHOST from Railway>
   DB_PORT = <copy MYSQLPORT from Railway>
   DB_USER = <copy MYSQLUSER from Railway>
   DB_PASSWORD = <copy MYSQLPASSWORD from Railway>
   DB_NAME = <copy MYSQLDATABASE from Railway>
   ```

   **Example:**
   ```
   DB_HOST = containers-us-west-123.railway.app
   DB_PORT = 6543
   DB_USER = root
   DB_PASSWORD = abc123xyz789
   DB_NAME = railway
   ```

5. **Also Add** (if not already set):
   ```
   PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN = <your Facebook Page Access Token>
   VERIFY_TOKEN = my_secret_token
   SECRET_KEY = quicksell-production-secret-2024
   ```

6. **Click "Save Changes"**
   - Render will automatically redeploy
   - Wait ~2-3 minutes

---

## Step 4: Verify Database Connection

1. **Wait for Render to finish deploying**

2. **Check Render Logs**
   - Should see: `✅ Database pool created successfully`
   - NOT: `⚠️ Database not configured`

3. **Test Health Endpoint**
   ```
   Open browser: https://automation-bot-xn9m.onrender.com/health
   
   Should show:
   {
     "status": "healthy",
     "bot": "running",
     "database": "connected"  ← Should say "connected"!
   }
   ```

4. **Test Admin Panel**
   ```
   Open browser: https://automation-bot-xn9m.onrender.com/admin
   
   Username: admin
   Password: admin123
   ```
