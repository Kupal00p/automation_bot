## Technical Details

### API Endpoints Used:

- `POST /admin/api/verifications/<order_id>/approve` - Approve
- `POST /admin/api/verifications/<order_id>/reject` - Reject

### Data Retrieved:
```json
{
  "verification": {
    "verification_type": "id_verification",
    "verification_status": "under_review",
    "id_image_url": "https://...",
    "selfie_image_url": "https://...",
    "id_type": "Driver's License",

## Security Considerations

1. **Image Privacy**: Verification images contain sensitive PII
2. **Secure Storage**: Images should be stored securely
3. **Access Control**: Only logged-in admins can view
4. **Audit Trail**: All approvals/rejections are logged
5. **Data Retention**: Follow GDPR/privacy laws

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't see verification images
**Solution**: Check if customer has submitted verification. Status should be "under_review"

### Issue: Images not loading
**Solution**: Check image URLs in database, verify hosting service is accessible

### Issue: Approve button not working
**Solution**: Ensure verification status is "under_review" or "pending"

### Issue: Customer didn't receive notification
**Solution**: Check messenger_id in database, verify notification service is running
